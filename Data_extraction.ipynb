should be played not only within its Laws but also within the TDF Spirit of the Game. Any action, which is seen to abuse this spirit, causes injury to the game itself. The major responsibility for ensuring the spirit of fair play rests with the captains and players.\n\nTDF  Cricket  main  objective  is  to  inculcate  Culture  of  Inclus\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\nTournament Specific Rules and Guidelines\n\n1. Unless rules are defined in this document, all other issues/rules to be followed according to ICC T20 Rules. Subject to the regulations outlined in this document, all other matters and rules governing the tournament shall be adhered to in accordance with the ICC T20 Rules. The ICC T20 Rules shall prevail in all respects, and any provisions not specifically addressed  in  this  document  shall  be  governed  by  the  relevant  rules  and\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\nb) If a player sustains an injury during the game, and both captains mutually agree, a 'by runner' provision may be allowed. The committee will not intervene in the decision unless requested by both captains\n\nc) In the \"by runner\" provision, the opposition captain selects the runner. A change may be requested, but the final decision rests with the opposition captain.\n\nTournament Format\n\nThe tournament consists of four rounds:\n\nRound 1: League Stage\n\nRound 2: Quarterfinals and Contender\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\n· In a reduced overs game, the committee will provide allotted overs based on total overs.\n\n· Umpires, Scorer, and captains will ensure these rules are enforced. If somehow a batsman faced more than the restrictive limit, he is immediately asked to retire when discovered of such instance. If a bowler bowls more than the allocation limit, he is immediately asked to discontinue  when  discovered  of  such  an  instance.  Balls  bowled  by  the  bow\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\n· Batting powerplay overs shall be chosen by the batting team after bowling powerplay completed during the innings.\n\n· During the Power Play, there cannot be more than two fielders in the Grass Field.\n\n· If a team is playing with less than 11 players on the field, fielders not at the ground are counted as if they were in the grass field.\n\n· Example:  if  a  team  is  fielding  with  8  players;  During  power  play  \n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\nMain & Leg Umpire\n\nRequest the main umpire to consult leg umpire in situations where the second bounce, keeper catches etc. Main umpire can discuss with leg umpire for full toss no-balls and make the final call. It is always advised for two umpires to consult and not rush to decision. If a leg umpire is from a playing team, a neutral main umpire can override leg umpire's call. A decision made by either of the ump\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\nKeeper & Field Changes\n\n· Umpire  should  be  notified  of  all  the  fielder  moments  in  and  out  of  the  field.  If  such notification is not provided, either umpire shall call or signal as a NO BALL '\n\n· Anytime  the  Wicketkeeper  makes  a  change  in  position  during  the  Over  towards  the Wickets,  it  is  the  Keeper's\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament Code of Conduct and Rule Book\n\nA replacement player can only be requested after the day's play has concluded and may be provided (depending on reserve list availability and circumstances) for the next day's games.\n\nLate to Ground\n\nPlayers arriving late should let the umpire know and wait for that over completion to be in the field. To bowl, he must wait one more over after coming to the field. As such no restriction for batsman.\n\nRetired Hurt\n\nRetired hurt players should come for batting at the end.

Please refer to free hit rules.\n\nAs per TDF Cricket, the following rules override the ICC no-ball rule\n\n· 1 ball per over is allowed by the bowler to bowl between the shoulder and head height but not above head\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nTDF\n\nDetroit Prof. Jayashankar Cricket Tournament\n\nCode of Conduct and Rule Book\n\nThe umpire shall call and signal No ball, if\n\n· If the ball bowled reaches the batsman at waist height without bouncing (Full Toss) unless it hits wickets, see the below figure.\n\n· Above shoulder (good bouncer) one per over allowed with warning. The second one in the same over is no-ball.
