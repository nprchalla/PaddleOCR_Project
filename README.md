# üß† Data Extraction Project

## üìò **Overview**
This project automates **data extraction and preprocessing** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.  
It is designed to **read, clean, transform, and prepare raw data** for further analysis or machine learning workflows.  
The notebook efficiently handles raw datasets, performs transformations, and outputs clean, structured data ready for analytics.

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Automated data extraction** from raw input sources  
- **Data cleaning and transformation** using Pandas and NumPy  
- **Handling missing, duplicate, and inconsistent values**  
- **Validation and quality checks** for data accuracy  
- **Lightweight and modular design** for easy reuse and integration

## üß© **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **pandas** ‚Äì Data manipulation  
- **numpy** ‚Äì Numerical computations  
- **matplotlib / seaborn** ‚Äì Visualization (optional)

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup and Execution Steps**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/data-extraction.git
cd data-extraction
```
### **Step 2: Clone the Repository** 
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
When activated, you‚Äôll see (venv) appear in your terminal prompt.

### **Step 3: Install Required Packages**
pip install -r requirements.txt
if, not manually import the core packages
pip install pandas numpy jupyter matplotlib seaborn

### **Step 4: Run the Notebook**
Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal: jupyter notebook
Then open the notebook file: Data_extraction.ipynb

### **Step 5: Review and Export Results**
After successful execution:
Review processed datasets and visual outputs.
Export cleaned data to desired formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.).
Validate output quality using summary statistics or sample checks.

### **How It Works**
Data Input: Reads data from raw files (CSV, Excel, or database).
Data Cleaning: Removes duplicates, fills missing values, and standardizes formats.
Transformation: Performs aggregation, reshaping, or encoding.
Validation: Ensures data integrity and accuracy.
Output: Generates a clean, structured dataset for analytics or machine learning.

### **Results**
Reduced manual data preparation time
Improved consistency and reliability of datasets
Optimized workflow for analytics and modeling teams

### **Next Steps**
Integrate this notebook into the larger analytics pipeline.
Implement logging for tracking and debugging.
Enhance extraction performance for large-scale datasets.
